# ANIMATION STUDIO

### *Narration based Animation with minimal effort*

A NodeJS powered animation studio app for creating animated videos from SVGs for narrated informational videos.
It runs in your browser, using localstorage and files to create and load files.

## How do I use it?

It allows users to draw simple drawings and convert them to SVG.
The general workflow is to have the audio first so the timing can be synced to the music/narration.

1. Import your finished production quality audio/narration
2. We will detect pauses and optionally do speech to text translation to give you the sections of your video.
3. Choose what each section will animate as (whether to keep the previous section on screen, background, etc)
4. Select timing for that section (one line at a time, all at once, delayed, and draw speed)

## TODO

- Create canvas and settings
- Save & Load Projects
- Detect pauses/gaps
- Detect
- Better name
- Logo?
- Setup video production pipeline
- Allow importing SVG files
