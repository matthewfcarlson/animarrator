# ANIMATION STUDIO

A NodeJS powered animation studio app for creating animated videos from SVGs for narrated informational videos.
It runs in your browser, using localstorage and files to create and load files.

## How do I use it?

It allows users to draw simple drawings and convert them to SVG.
The general workflow is to have the audio first so the timing can be synced to the music/narration.

## TODO

- Create canvas and settings
- Better name
- Logo?
- Setup video production pipeline
- Allow importing SVG files
